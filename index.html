                        Ram just completed his studies and is now thinking about getting A job. He is confused whether
                        he should go for a private sector job or a government sector job.
                        He is looking for a job in <u style="color:brown">the technical field.</u> He is also interested
                        in arts and non-technical jobs. He is looking for a job that will provide him with a good salary
                        and a good work-life balance.
                        After looking at the data of Private sector jobs, he found that there are more jobs available in
                        the technical field and most of them are getting <u style="color:brown">salary over 1500K
                            annually.</u>
                        So he can provide a better life for his family.
                        There is also good work-life balance in Private Sector jobs, as he has to work only <u
                            style="color:brown">4 days a week.</u>
                        Private sector jobs also tend to offer greater flexibility in terms of career growth, allowing
                        individuals to progress and specialize in their preferred areas, and adapt to changing industry
                        trends.
                        One other advantage of private sector jobs is that corporates supports their employees based on their performance. So it is more easy to climb the corporate ladder and getting promoted in Private Sector jobs.
                         Whereas in the Government Sector jobs, it is more difficult to get promoted.

                    <p>Looking at the government jobs visualization, Ram realized that government jobs can offer a
                        multitude of advantages over private sector jobs.
                        Firstly, government jobs often provide job security and stability, which can be appealing to
                        individuals seeking long-term employment.
                        The major chunk of people are getting paid somewhere <u style="color:brown">between
                            900-1200K</u> which is definately less than the private sector jobs.
                        More than that, Government employees work somewhere between <u style="color:brown">5-6 days a
                            week</u> which is more than the private sector but the <u style="color:brown">job
                            security</u> is more.
                        This stability can offer peace of mind and a sense of security for employees, allowing them to
                        plan for the future and have a reliable source of income.
                        <u>There is also an conception in india that fathers tend to choose their son-in-law who is in
                            government job as they have a good job security and a good pension plan.</u>
                        Ram found out that government jobs can offer attractive benefits packages, including health
                        insurance, retirement plans, and paid time off, which may be more comprehensive compared to
                        private sector jobs.
